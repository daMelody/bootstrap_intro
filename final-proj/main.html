      Socrates continues the political measures of the censorship of poetry: (iv) the
      underworld<br />
      should not be portrayed as a bad place so that the guardians will not be too afraid of
      death<br />
      (386b); (v) the heroes and gods should not be presented lamenting so that the guardians
      can<br />
      develop courage (387e); (vi) poetry should prevent people from laughing violently
      (388e);<br />
      (vii) poetry should promote the guardian’s sense of truth-telling but with the willingness
      to<br />
      lie when this is conducive to the good of the city (389b); (viii) it should promote<br />
      self-discipline and obedience (389c-d); (ix) it should not include stories that contribute
      to<br />
      avarice (390d); (x) it should not include stories that contribute to hubris or impiety
      (391a).<br />
      Socrates moves on to discuss the manner in which stories should be told (392d). He
      divides<br />
      such manners into simple narration (in third person) and imitative narration (in first
      person,<br />
      392d). To keep the guardians doing only their job, Socrates argues that the guardians
      may<br />
      imitate only what is appropriate for this (394e-395d). The just city should allow only
      modes<br />
      and rhythms that fit the content of poetry allowed in the just city (398b-399c).
      Socrates<br />
      explains how good art can lead to the formation of good character and make people more
      likely<br />
      to follow their reason (400e-402c). Socrates turns to the physical education of the
      guardians<br />
      and says that it should include physical training that prepares them for war, a careful
      diet,<br />
      and habits that contribute to the avoidance of doctors (403c-405b). Physical education
      should<br />
      be geared to benefit the soul rather than the body, since the body necessarily benefits
      when<br />
      the soul is in a good condition, whereas the soul does not necessarily benefit when the
      body<br />
      is in a good condition (410b-c).<br />
      <br />
      Socrates begins to describe how the rulers of the just city are to be selected from the
      class<br />
      of the guardians: they need to be older, strong, wise, and wholly unwilling to do
      anything<br />
      other than what is advantageous to the city (412b-414b). Socrates suggests that they need
      to<br />
      tell the citizens a myth that should be believed by subsequent generations in order for<br />
      everyone to accept his position in the city (414b-415d). The myth of metals portrays
      each<br />
      human as having a precious metal in them: those naturally suited to be rulers have gold,
      those<br />
      suited to be guardians have silver, and those suited for farming and the other crafts
      have<br />
      bronze.<br />
      <br />
      Socrates proceeds to discuss the living and housing conditions of the guardians: they will
      not<br />
      have private property, they will have little privacy, they will receive what they need
      from<br />
      the city via taxation of the other classes, and they will live communally and have
      common<br />
      messes (415e-416e).<br />
      <br />
      d. Book IV<br />
      Adeimantus complains that the guardians in the just city will not be very happy (419a).<br />
      Socrates points out that the aim is to make the whole city, and not any particular class,
      as<br />
      happy as possible (420b). Socrates discusses several other measures for the city as a whole
      in<br />
      order to accomplish this. There should be neither too much wealth nor too much poverty in
      the<br />
      city since these cause social strife (421d-422a). The just city should be only as large
      in<br />
      size as would permit it to be unified and stable (423b). Socrates reemphasizes the
      importance<br />
      of the guardian’s education and suggests that the guardians will possess wives and children
      in<br />
      common (423e). He suggests that they should only allow very limited ways by which
      innovations<br />
      may be introduced to education or change in the laws (424b-425e). The just city will
      follow<br />
      traditional Greek religious customs (427b).<br />
      <br />
      With the founding of the just city completed, Socrates proceeds to discuss justice (427d).
      He<br />
      claims that the city they have founded is completely good and virtuous and thus it is
      wise,<br />
      courageous, moderate, and just (427e). Justice will be what remains once they find the
      other<br />
      three virtues in it, namely wisdom, courage, and moderation (428a). The wisdom of the
      just<br />
      city is found in its rulers and it is the type of knowledge that allows them to rule the
      city<br />
      well (428b-d). The courage of the just city is found in its military and it is correct
      and<br />
      lawful belief about what to fear and what not to fear (429a-430b). The city’s moderation
      or<br />
      self-discipline is its unanimity in following the just city’s structure in terms of who
      should<br />
      rule and who should be ruled (430d-432a). The city’s justice consists in each class
      performing<br />
      its proper function (433a-b).<br />
      <br />
      Socrates then proceeds to find the corresponding four virtues in the individual (434d).<br />
      Socrates defends the analogy of the city and the individual (435a-b) and proceeds to<br />
      distinguish three analogous parts in the soul with their natural functions (436b). By
      using<br />
      instances of psychological conflict, he distinguishes the function of the rational part
      from<br />
      that of the appetitive part of the soul (439a). Then he distinguishes the function of
      the<br />
      spirited part from the functions of the two other parts (439e-440e). The function of the<br />
      rational part is thinking, that of the spirited part the experience of emotions, and that
      of<br />
      the appetitive part the pursuit of bodily desires. Socrates explains the virtues of the<br />
      individual’s soul and how they correspond to the virtues of the city (441c-442d).
      Socrates<br />
      points out that one is just when each of the three parts of the soul performs its
      function<br />
      (442d). Justice is a natural balance of the soul’s parts and injustice is an imbalance of
      the<br />
      parts of the soul (444e). Socrates is now ready to answer the question of whether justice
      is<br />
      more profitable than injustice that goes unpunished (444e-445a). To do so he will need
      to<br />
      examine the various unjust political regimes and the corresponding unjust individuals in
      each<br />
      (445c-e).<br />
      <br />
      e. Book V<br />
      Socrates is about to embark on a discussion of the unjust political regimes and the<br />
      corresponding unjust individuals when he is interrupted by Adeimantus and Polemarchus<br />
      (449a-b). They insist that he needs to address the comment he made earlier that the
      guardians<br />
      will possess the women and the children of the city in common (449b-d). Socrates
      reluctantly<br />
      agrees (450a-451b) and begins with the suggestion that the guardian women should perform
      the<br />
      same job as the male guardians (451c-d). Some may follow convention and object that
      women<br />
      should be given different jobs because they differ from men by nature (453a-c). Socrates<br />
      responds by indicating that the natural differences between men and women are not
      relevant<br />
      when it comes to the jobs of protecting and ruling the city. Both sexes are naturally
      suited<br />
      for these tasks (454d-e). Socrates goes on to argue that the measure of allowing the women
      to<br />
      perform the same tasks as the men in this way is not only feasible but also best. This is
      the<br />
      case since the most suited people for the job will be performing it (456c).<br />
      <br />
      Socrates also proposes that there should be no separate families among the members of
      the<br />
      guardian class: the guardians will possess all the women and children in common
      (457c-d).<br />
      Socrates proceeds to discuss how this measure is for the best and Glaucon allows him to
      skip<br />
      discussing its feasibility (458a-c). The best guardian men are to have sex with the best<br />
      guardian women to produce offspring of a similar nature (458d-459d). Socrates describes
      the<br />
      system of eugenics in more detail. In order to guarantee that the best guardian men have
      sex<br />
      with the best guardian women, the city will have marriage festivals supported by a
      rigged<br />
      lottery system (459e-460a). The best guardian men will also be allowed to have sex with
      as<br />
      many women as they desire in order to increase the likelihood of giving birth to children
      with<br />
      similar natures (460a-b). Once born, the children will be taken away to a rearing pen to
      be<br />
      taken care of by nurses and the parents will not be allowed to know who their own children
      are<br />
      (460c-d). This is so that the parents think of all the children as their own. Socrates<br />
      recognizes that this system will result in members of the same family having intercourse
      with<br />
      each other (461c-e).<br />
      <br />
      Socrates proceeds to argue that these arrangements will ensure that unity spreads
      throughout<br />
      the city (462a-465d). Responding to Adeimantus’ earlier complaint that the guardians would
      not<br />
      be happy, Socrates indicates that the guardians will be happy with their way of life;
      they<br />
      will have their needs satisfied and will receive sufficient honor from the city
      (465d-e).<br />
      Thereafter, Socrates discusses how the guardians will conduct war (466e).<br />
      <br />
      Glaucon interrupts him and demands an account explaining how such a just city can come
      into<br />
      being (471c-e). Socrates admits that this is the most difficult criticism to address
      (472a).<br />
      Then he explains that the theoretical model of the just city they constructed remains
      valid<br />
      for discussing justice and injustice even if they cannot prove that such a city can come
      to<br />
      exist (472b-473b). Socrates claims that the model of the just city cannot come into
      being<br />
      until philosophers rule as kings or kings become philosophers (473c-d). He also points
      out<br />
      that this is the only possible route by which to reach complete happiness in both public
      and<br />
      private life (473e). Socrates indicates that they to, discuss philosophy and philosophers
      to<br />
      justify these claims (474b-c). Philosophers love and pursue all of wisdom (475b-c) and
      they<br />
      especially love the sight of truth (475e). Philosophers are the only ones who recognize
      and<br />
      find pleasure in what is behind the multiplicity of appearances, namely the single Form<br />
      (476a-b). Socrates distinguishes between those who know the single Forms that are and
      those<br />
      who have opinions (476d). Those who have opinions do not know, since opinions have
      becoming<br />
      and changing appearances as their object, whereas knowledge implies that the objects
      thereof<br />
      are stable (476e-477e).<br />
